# Instagram-bot
Instagram bot using Selenium and Python
The fundamental approach behind this is to use the automated browsing capabilities provided by Selenium to enter into your Instagram account, scroll past all of those pesky pop-ups, search the profiles of some notable high-profile people, and simply start following people who follow them randomly.
This is a simple script aimed to demonstrate how the Selenium tools may be used to interact with the Instagram website, and there is plenty of space for improvement.
